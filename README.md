# Wordle Archive + Today's

ðŸ”— https://nincodedo.github.io/wordle_archive/

A small add-on to [DevangThakkar's wordle archive](https://github.com/DevangThakkar/wordle_archive) which allows today's Wordle to be played as well. This is originally an archive for [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) by [Josh Wardle](https://twitter.com/powerlanguish) and built on top of [Word Master](https://octokatherine.github.io/word-master/) created by [Katherine Peterson](https://twitter.com/katherinecodes).
